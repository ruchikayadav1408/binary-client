# NETWORKING -BINARY MLM 🔥

Binary MLM plan is based on a 2*2 matrix which means that a member can recruit only two direct frontline distributors under him. These distributors can further recruit two members under them respectively.  So, every member has got two legs. The structure continues thereby giving rise to an infinite binary tree that goes deeper without complications. Upon adding two new members on either side of the subtree, a binary tree gets formed.

At the top, there is a user who will add two people, one on the left and one on the right. Users will register by entering their user ID on the sponsor's ID field, and they will be placed under the user whose ID they entered. This process continues, with each user adding two more people under them.
